```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r read-data, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
training = read_csv("../../data/training_tallskinny.csv")
validation = read_csv("../../data/validation_tallskinny.csv")
interest_topics = read_csv("../../data/interest_topics.csv")
```



```{r first}
training %>%
  names()

interest_topics %>%
  names()

user1 <- training %>%
  filter(userID == 1) 


user1Interest <- full_join(user1, interest_topics)
user1Interest$userID <- 1
user1Interest <- user1Interest %>%
  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0))

joined <- full_join(training, interest_topics)

joined %>%
  group_by(topic_name) %>%
  count(inAudience) %>%
  filter(inAudience == TRUE) 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
